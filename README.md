## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Service Structure
Each service follows a consistent structure:
```
service-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/          # Database models
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/          # API routes
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py         # Application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/               # Virtual environment
```

### Adding New Services
1. Create service directory in `services/` or `ai-services/`
2. Use `manus-create-flask-app` to scaffold the service
3. Implement models and routes
4. Add service to `docker-compose.yml`
5. Update API Gateway routing

### Database Schema
The platform uses MySQL with the following main tables:
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `products` - Product catalog
- `cart_items` - Shopping cart items
- `orders` - Order records
- `order_items` - Order line items
- `payments` - Payment transactions

## üîß Configuration
